Description:
This program utilizes the python request library and json to interact with the Spoonacular
API and give a list of viable recipes depending on what ingredients the user already has.

How to use:
1. Run the python program (I wrote and tested the program using Python 2 so there might be some compatability errors if you are using Python 3).
2. Enter what ingredients you have (each item separated by a string).
3. Enter how many recipe results you want returned.
4. Now you can see a list of what to buy the next time you go grocery shopping!

Reflection:
I really enjoyed working on this project because I felt like I learned a lot in a short amount of time. The concepts used on this project
were very different from what I usually learn in classes and use in programming homework. I refreshed on python, learned about JSON and 
opened a whole new world of possibilties with API's. API are really fascinating and I will definitely look into them more for future projects.

Difficulties I encountered:
I couldn't get my API key to be authenticated (kept getting 401 error) through the direct endpoint so I decided to go through the RapidAPI 
host instead and that seems to work perfectly fine.
