Description:
This program utilizes the python request library and json to interact with the Spoonacular
API and give a list of viable recipes depending on what ingredients the user already has.

How to use:
1. Run the python program (I wrote and tested the program using Python 2 so there might be some compatability errors if you are using Python 3).
2. Enter what ingredients you have (each item separated by a string).
3. Enter how many recipe results you want returned.
4. Now you can see a list of what to buy the next time you go grocery shopping!
